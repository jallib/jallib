forever loop
   -- debounce will return 2 at the point where the button 
   -- has pressed (assuming it's wired to ground) and held stable
   -- for 100 samples. In this case, with a 1000us delay in the loop,
   -- that's after around 0.1 seconds.
   --
   -- You could also use debounce_fast(button, state) here, in which 
   -- case it will switch immediately after the button is pressed, but
   -- will be more sensitive to noise (not an issue where the button is
   -- a switch, but if it's a thresholded analogue signal with noise, this
   -- might not be what you want).
   if (debounce(button, state) == 2) then
	  -- Toggle the LED.
	  led = !led
