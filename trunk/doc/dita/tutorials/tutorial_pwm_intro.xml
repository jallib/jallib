    <p id="firstcontent">In the following  tutorials, we&apos;re going to (try to) have some fun with PWM. PWM stands for <xref href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWM" format="html">Pulse Width Modulation</xref>, and is quite weird when you first face this (this was at least my first feeling). So here&apos;s a brief explanation of what it is about.</p>
    <section>
      <title>How does PWM look like ?...</title>
      <p>PWM is about switching one pin (or more) high and low, at different frequencies and duty cycles. This is a on/off process. You can either vary:<ul>
          <li>the <b>frequency</b>,</li>
          <li>or the <b>duty cycle</b>, that is the proportion where the pin will be high</li>
        </ul><fig>
          <title>PWM: same duty cycle, different frequencies.</title>
          <image href="images/pwm_freq.png" placement="break"/>
          <p><i>Both have a 50% duty cycle (50% on, 50% off), but the upper one&apos;s frequency is twice the bottom</i></p>
        </fig><fig>
          <title>PWM: same frequency, different duty cycles</title>
          <image href="images/pwm_duty.png" placement="break"/>
          <p><i>Three different duty cycle (10%, 50% and 90%), all at the same frequency</i></p>
        </fig></p>
      <p>But what is PWM for ? What can we do with it ? Many things, like:<ul>
          <li>producing variable voltage (to control DC motor speed, for instance)</li>
          <li>playing sounds: duty cycle is constant, frequency is variable</li>
          <li>playing PCM wave file (PCM is Pulse Code Modulation)</li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul></p>
    </section>
    <p>That said, we&apos;re now goind to experiment these two major properties.</p>
