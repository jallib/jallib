   JAL is a high level language designed to hide the general
   nuisance of programming a MicroChip PIC processor. It is
   derived from the original JAL by Wouter van Ooijen (see
   http://www.voti.nl/jal/index.html), which is loosely base on
   Pascal.

   JAL is not case sensitive.

Chapter 1. Definitions and Conventions

1.1. Definitions

   The following abbreviations are used throughout this guide:

   bit
          A bit within a bit, 0 <= bit <= 7

   comment
          Comments begin with either "--" or ";" and continue
          through the end of the line.

   constant
          A numeric constant.

   expression
          An expression is a sequence of values and operations.
          Expressions are subdivided into:

        cexpr -- constant expression
                An expression that can be fully evaluated at
                compile time. For example 1 + 2.

        expr -- any expression.
                An expression is anything that evaluates to a
                value, for example: b + c, x + 1, etc.

        lexpr -- logical expression
                A logical expression. This differs from an
                expression in that the result is 0 if the
                expression is zero, and 1 if the expression is
                anything other than 0.

   identifier
          Identifies a variable, constant procedure, function,
          label, etc. Must begin with a letter or '_' followed by
          any number of of letters (a-z), digits (0-9), or '_'.
          Note that identifiers beginning with '_' are reserved
          for the compiler.

   program
          A program is simply a sequence of statements. Unlike
          other languages, in JAL, if the execution runs out of
          statements, the processor will be put to sleep.

   scope
          Scope is the `visibility' of an identifier. Each
          statement_block creates a new scope. Anything declared
          within this scope will not be visible once the scope
          ends.

          A variable can be redefined in a block as follows:

                VAR BYTE x, z
                ...
                IF (x) THEN
                  VAR WORD x, y ; all references to x will refer
                                ; to this definition
                  ...
                END IF
                ...
                VAR WORD x ; this is illegal because x already exists

   statement
          A single assignment, definition, control (BLOCK, CASE,
          IF) or looping (FOR, FOREVER, REPEAT, WHILE).

   statement_block
          A sequence of statements. Variables, constants,
          procedures, and functions defined in a statement_block
          will not be visible outside of the statement_block.

   token
          The JAL compiler sees only a stream of tokens. An entire
          program can be written without any line breaks or extra
          spaces, except of course for comments which are
          terminated by and end of line.

   var -- variable
     __________________________________________________________

1.2. Conventions

   The following notational conventions are used throughout this
   guide:

   { a | b | c } -- one of
          must be one of a,b,c

   KEYWORD -- A JALv2 keyword
          Upper case denotes a JALv2 keyword

   '...' -- literal
          Anything between the quotes must be typed exactly.

   [...] -- optional
          Anything between the brackets is optional.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Variables, Constants, Aliases

2.1. Types

   The following are the list of types understood by the JALv2
   compiler.

   Table 2-1. JALv2 Built-in Types
    Type        Description                  Range
   BIT^1   1 bit boolean value   0..1
   SBIT^1  1 bit signed value    -1..0
   BYTE^1  8 bit unsigned value  0..255
   SBYTE^1 8 bit signed value    -128..127
   WORD    16 bit unsigned value 0..65,535
   SWORD   16 bit signed value   -32,768..32,767
   DWORD   32 bit unsigned value 0..4,294,967,296
   SDWORD  32 bit signed value   -2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647
   FLOAT^1 floating point value  +/-10^-44..10^38

   ^1base types

   The larger types, [S]WORD, [S]DWORD are simply derived from the
   base types using the width specifier. For example, WORD is
   equivalent to BYTE*2, the later can be used interchangably with
   the former.

   Floating point arithmetic is *very* expensive in terms of both
   code and data and should best be avoided. It is nominally based
   upon IEEE 754, though does not raise exceptions nor handle
   overflow or special numbers (+/-Infinity, +/-NaN, -0, etc). A
   floating point value is represented in 4 BYTEs.

   A note needs to be made concerning the BIT type. In the
   original JAL language, the BIT type acted more like a boolean
   -- if assigned 0, the value stored would be zero, if assigned
   any non-zero value, the value stored would be one. This
   convention is still used in JALv2.

   However, JALv2 also understands BIT types more like C
   bitfields. If, instead of BIT one uses the type BIT*1, the
   value assigned would be masked appropriately (in other words
   BIT*1 y = z translates internally to BIT*1 y = (z & 0x0001).

   Even though the predefined larger types use standard widths (2
   and 4), there is no such requirement imposed by the language.
   If you need a three byte value, use BYTE*3. The only upper
   limit is the requirement that any value fit within one data
   bank.

   Finally, BIT and BYTE are distinct, so defining a value of
   BIT*24 is not the same as defining a value of BYTE*3!
     __________________________________________________________

2.2. Arrays

   JAL allows one dimensional arrays of any non-bit type. These
   are defined during variable definition using the notation:
        VAR type '[' cexpr ']' id

   This defines id as type with cexpr elements. These are accessed
   using brackets. The elements are numbered from zero, so for 5
   elements the accessors are 0 to 4.

   Example:
        VAR BYTE stuff[5], xx

        xx = 2
        stuff[0] = 1
        stuff[xx] = 2
        xx = stuff[xx]

   Note: There is no error checking when an array is accessed with
   a variable. In the above example, if xx is 5 no error will be
   generated, but the results will not be as expected.
     __________________________________________________________

2.3. Records

   Records are special types, composed of fields which are
   built-in types, arrays, and/or other records. These are defined
   with:
      RECORD identifier IS
          type[*cexpr] id0 [ '[' cexpr ']' ]
          ...
      END RECORD

   Once defined, the RECORD identifier can be use anywhere a
   simple type can be used. Each individual field is accessed
   using '.'

   Example:
        RECORD eyeinfo IS
          BYTE left
          BYTE right
        END RECORD

        ;
        ; a record can be initialized on definition as follows:
        ;
        VAR eyeinfo eye = { 3, 4 }
        ;
        ; alternately, each field is accessed with the '.' operator:
        ;
        eye.left = 1
        eye.right = 2
        ;
        ; A more complex example. This sets eyes[0] to {1,2},
        ; eyes[1] to {3,4} and eyes[2] to {5,6}:
        ;
        VAR eyeinfo eyes[5] = { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 }, { 5, 6 } }
        ;
        ; Finally, nested records and arrays are supported
        ;
        RECORD face_r IS
          eyeinfo eyes
          BYTE    nose
          BYTE    freckels[5]
        END RECORD

        VAR face_r[5] = {
          { { 1,2 }, 3, {4, 5, 6, 7, 8} },
          { { 2,1 }, 3, {8, 7, 6, 5, 4} }
        }
     __________________________________________________________

2.4. Variables

   A variable is simply an identifier that holds a value. These
   identifiers have types associated which define how much space
   is required to hold the value. The following types are
   built-in:

   The complete format for defining a variable is:
      VAR [VOLATILE] [SHARED] type[*cexpr] identifier [ '[' [ cexpr ] ']
' ]
        [ { AT cexpr [ ':' bit ] | var [ ':' bit ] | '{' cexpr1[',' cexp
r2...] '}'
          | IS var }
        [ '=' cexpr | '{' cexpr1',' ... '}' | '"'...'"' ]
        [',' identifier2...]

   This is, by far, the most complex construct in all of JAL, so
   I'll describe it one piece at a time below. Once variable
   definition is understood, everything else is easy!

   VAR
          Denotes the beginning of a variable definition.

   VOLATILE
          The VOLATILE keyword guarantees that a variable that is
          either used or assigned will not be optimized away, and
          the variable will be only read (or written) once when
          evaluating an expression.

          Normally, if a variable is assigned a value that is
          never used, the assignment is removed and the variable
          is not allocated any space. If the assignment is an
          expression, the expression *will* be fully evaluated. If
          a variable is used, but never assigned, all instances of
          the variable will be replaced with the constant 0 (of
          the appropriate type) and the variable will not be
          allocated any space.

   SHARED
          Tells the compiler that this variable exists in shared
          memory, so there is no need to set bank bits (14 bit
          cores), or the BSR register (16 bit cores).

   type[*cexpr]
          type is one of the predefined types (above). If type is
          BIT, BYTE, or SBYTE it can be extended using [*cexpr].
          For BYTE and SBYTE, this means the variable will be
          defined as an integer using cexpr bytes, eg WORD is
          simply shorthand for BYTE*2.

          If type is BIT, the definition changes. A BIT variable,
          as defined in JAL, is really of type boolean. When
          assigned any non-zero value, it takes on the value of 1.
          Using the [*cexpr], the definition changes to be more
          like a C bit field: assignment is masked. For example:

                VAR BIT*2 cc

          when assigning to cc, the assignment is:

                cc = (value & 0x03)

   identifier
          Any valid JAL identifier

   '[' [ cexpr ] ']'
          Defines an array of cexpr elements. The array index
          starts at 0 and continues through (cexpr - 1). cexpr
          must be >= 1. An array *must* fit entirely within a
          single PIC data bank.

          If cexpr is ommitted, the '=' term must exist and the
          size of the array will be set to the number of
          initializers present.

          BIT arrays are *not* supported.

   AT cexpr [ ':' bit ]
          Places the new variable at location cexpr. If it is a
          BIT variable, [ ':' bit ] defines the bit offset with
          the location. Any location uses for explicit placement
          will not be allocated to another variable.

   AT var [ ':' bit ]
          Places the new variable at the same location as an
          existing variable. Any location uses for explicit
          placement will not be allocated to another variable.

   AT '{' cexpr1[',' cexpr2...] '}'
          Places the new variable at multiple locations. On the
          PIC, many of the special purpose registers are mirrored
          in two or more data banks. Telling the compiler which
          locations hold the variable allows it to optimize the
          data access bits.

   IS var
          Tells the compiler that this identifier is simply an
          alias for another. This has been deprecated, use "ALIAS
          identifier IS identifier1" instead.

   '=' expr
          Shorthand assignment. The variable will be assigned
          expr.

   '=' '{' expr1 [',' expr2...] '}'
          For an array variable, the elements will be assigned
          expr1, expr2, ...

   '=' '"' ... '"'
          For a variable array, this assigns each ASCII value
          between '"' and '"' to one element of the constant
          array. Unlike C, there is no terminating NUL.

   '=' "..."
          For an array variable, the elements will be assigned one
          the ASCII values inside the quotes.

          = "abc" is equivalent to = {"a", "b", "c"}

   ',' identifier2...
          Allows defining multiple variables with the same
          attributes:

                VAR BYTE a,b,c
     __________________________________________________________

2.5. Constants

2.5.1. Unnamed Constants

   An unnamed numeric constant has the type UNIVERSAL, which is a
   32-bit signed value. When a value of type UNIVERSAL is used in
   an operation, it is converted to the type of the other operand.

   An exception to above is floating point constants have type
   FLOAT.

   Numeric constants have the following formats:

   12 -- decimal
   0x12 -- hexadecimal
   0b01 -- binary
   0q01 -- octal
   "a" -- ASCII
   "1.23" -- FLOAT

   An ASCII constant evaluates to the first character except when
   used to initialize a constant or variable array in which case
   each character is used as one entry.

   The full format of a floating point constant is:
        [+|-]###.[###[e[+|-]###]

   For example:
            VAR BYTE ch = "123"    ' ch is set to '1'
            VAR BYTE str[] = "123" ' str[0] is set to '1'
                                   ' str[1] is set to '2'
                                   ' str[2] is set to '3'

   An ASCII constant allows the C language escaping rules as
   follows:

   Table 2-2. ASCII Constant Escaping
   Sequence        Value
   "\ooo"   octal constant
   "\a"     bell
   "\b"     backspace
   "\f"     formfeed
   "\n"     line feed
   "\qooo"  octal constant
   "\r"     carriage return
   "\t"     horizontal tab
   "\v"     vertical tab
   "\xdd"   hexidecimal constant
   "\zbbb"  "binary constant"
   "\\"     A single '\'

   constants other than ASCII constants may also contain any
   number of underscores ("_") which are ignored, but are useful
   for grouping. For example: 0b0000_1111
     __________________________________________________________

2.5.2. Named Constants

   The complete format for defining a named constant is:
          CONST [type[*cexpr]] identifier [ '[' [ cexpr ] ']' ]
            '=' { cexpr | '{' cexpr1[',' cexpr2...]'}' | '"'...'"'}
            [ ',' identifier2...]

   CONST
          CONST denotes the beginning of a constant definition
          clause.

   type[*cexpr]
          Defines the type of the constant. If none is given, the
          constant becomes universal type which is 32 bit signed.

   '[' [ cexpr ] ']'
          Defines a constant array (see array variable types). A
          constant array will not take any space unless it is
          indexed at least once with a non-constant subscript. On
          the PIC, constant arrays consume *code* space, not
          *data* space, and are limited to 255 elements.

          If cexpr is ommitted, the size of the array will be
          determined by the number of initializers used.

   '=' cexpr
          For non-array constants this assigns the value to the
          constant

   '=' '{' cexpr[',' cexpr2...] '}'
          For arrays of constants this assigns the value to each
          element. There must be the same number of cexprs as
          there are elements defined.

   '=' '"' ... '"'
          For an array of constants, this assigns each ASCII value
          between '"' and '"' to one element of the constant
          array. Unlike C, there is no terminating NUL.
     __________________________________________________________

2.5.3. String Literals (introduced with JALv2.4p)

   String literals are enclosed in quotation markes '"'...'"' and
   can be used where ever an array of characters is allowed. The
   ASCII constant escaping noted under, `Unnamed Constants,'
   applies to each characterw within the string literal.

   Note that a string literal terminates with the first NUL
   characters (0x00).
     __________________________________________________________

2.6. Aliases

   Aliases allow a multiple identifiers (variables, named
   constants, sub-programs) to refer to the same object.

   The foramt for defining an alias is:
        ALIAS identifier IS identifier2

   Often it is useful to allow a variable or constant be refered
   to by multiple names. For example, if on a certain project
   pin_a1 is a red LED, you might prefer to refer to it as
   RED_LED. That way if, on a different project pin_a2 is the red
   LED, you'd need only change the alias and everything else would
   continue to work fine.

   '&' Binary AND Promotion^2
   '|' Binary OR Promotion^2
   '^' Binary exclusive OR Promotion^2

   ^1shift right: If the left operand is signed, the shift is
   arithmetic (sign preserving). If unsigned, it is a simple
   binary shift.

   ^2promotion: The promotion rules are tricky, here are the
   cases:

   If either operand is FLOAT, the result is FLOAT.
   If one of the operands is UNIVERSAL and the other is not, the
   result is the same as the non-UNIVERSAL operand.
   If both operands have the same signedness and width, the result
   is that of the operands.
   If both operands have the same width, and one is unsigned, the
   result is unsigned.
   If one operand is wider than the other, the other operand will
   be promoted to the wider type.

   ^3These operators allow FLOAT types.

   ^4Floating point numbers should never be compared for equality
   due to the imprecise way in which they are stored. Attempting
   to do so will result in a warning from the compiler. Two
   different operations which should yield an identical
   mathmatical result may compare unequal. The correct way to
   compare two floating point numbers, say A and B, is `abs((A -
   B)/B) < 1e-6' (floating point values have a nominal precision
   of 6 - 9 digits).

   ^5Keep in mind that multiplication and division, even between
   integer types are very expensive operations in both code size
   and data size (see Chapter 11: Build-in Function).
     __________________________________________________________

3.2. Casting

   Casting is the operation of changing the type of a value. This
   can be necessary for a number of reasons: when assigning a
   larger value to a smaller one, say a WORD to a BYTE, the
   compiler will issue a warning. An explicit cast will eliminate
   that warning:
        VAR WORD xx
        VAR BYTE yy
        ;
        ; the following assignment will issue:
        ; warning: assignment to smaller type; truncation possible
        ;
        yy = xx
        ;
        ; no warning will be generated below
        ;
        yy = BYTE(xx)

   In the first case, the compiler wants you to know there might
   be an issue (a rather common one). In the second case, you've
   explicitly told the compiler you know these types are
   different, but that is OK.

   Another case where casting is necessary is to guarantee correct
   promotion during an operation. Take the following:
        VAR WORD xx
        VAR BYTE yy
        ;
        ; this is not likely to do what you expect
        ;
        xx = yy * yy
        ;
        ; this will generate the correct result
        ;
        xx = WORD(yy) * WORD(yy)

   Remember that an operator only sees its two operands, it has no
   other context. Say the value of yy is 255. In the first case xx
   will be assigned a value of 1: the lower eight bits of the
   result. In the second case, the value of yy is promoted to a
   WORD, so xx will be assigned 65025 which is more likely what
   you would expect.
     __________________________________________________________

3.3. Expressions

   An expression is simply values (variable or constant) and
   operators. For example:
        y = x
        y = x + y
        y = -x - y
        y = (5 + (3 - 2x)) / z

   Please take time to look at the operator and casting sections,
   as many bug reports have been generated by a misunderstanding.

   Like C, but unlike Pascal, variables of different types can be
   mixed freely in an expression. In this case, the promotion
   rules listed under "operators" are in effect.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Flow Control

4.1. BLOCK

   Syntax:
        BLOCK
          statement_block
        END BLOCK

   Creates a new block. Any variables defined in this block go out
   of scope at the block. Mainly useful with the CASE statement
   (below).
     __________________________________________________________

4.2. CASE

   Syntax:
        CASE expr OF
          cexpr1[',' cexpr1a...] ':' statement
          [ cexpr2[',' cexpr2a...] ':' statement ]
          [ OTHERWISE statement ]
        END CASE

   expr is evaluated and compared against each cexpr listed. If a
   match occurs, the statement to the right of the matching cexpr
   is executed. If no match occurs, the statement after OTHERWISE
   is executed. If there is no OTHERWISE, control continues after
   END CASE. Unlike Pascal, the behavior is completely defined if
   there is no matching expression.

   Unlike C (but like Pascal) there is no explicit break. After a
   statement is processed, control proceeds past the END CASE.

   Each cexpr must evaluate to a unique value.

   Example:
        CASE xx OF
          1:     yy = 3
          2,5,7: yy = 4
          10:    BLOCK
                   yy = 5
                   zz = 6
                 END BLOCK
          OTHERWISE zz = 0
        END CASE

   Note that only one statement is allowed in each case, thus the
   reason for BLOCK as BLOCK...END BLOCK is considered a single
   statement.
     __________________________________________________________

4.3. FOR

   Syntax:
        FOR expr [ USING var ] LOOP
          statement_block
          [ EXIT LOOP ]
        END LOOP

   statement_block is executed expr times. If USING var is
   defined, the index is kept in var, beginning with zero and
   incrementing towards expr. If var is not large enough to hold
   expr, a warning is generated. If [EXIT LOOP] is used, the loop
   is immediately exited.

   Note: expr is evaluated once on entry to the FOR statement.

   On normal exit, var is equal to expr. After, `EXIT LOOP,' var
   holds whatever value it had at the beginning of the loop.

   November 2010 -- a minor enhancement has been made at the
   request of the users. If expr is a cexpr and is one larger than
   var can hold, the loop will be exited when var rolls over to
   zero. In this case, on exit var will be zero.

   Example:
        VAR BYTE n

        FOR 256 USING n LOOP
          ...
        END LOOP

   On exit, n will be zero.
        xx = 0
        FOR 10 LOOP
          xx = xx + 1
          IF (xx = 5) THEN
            EXIT LOOP
          END IF
        END LOOP
     __________________________________________________________

4.4. FOREVER

   Syntax:
        FOREVER LOOP
          statement_block
          [ EXIT LOOP ]
        END LOOP

   statement_block is executed forever unless [EXIT LOOP] is
   encountered, in which case the loop is immediately terminated.
   This is commonly used for the main loop in a program because an
   embedded program like this never ends.

   Example:
        xx = 5
        yy = 6
        FOREVER LOOP
          READ_ADC()
          CHANGE_SPEED()
          IF (speed = 5) THEN
            EXIT LOOP
          END IF
        END LOOP
     __________________________________________________________

4.5. IF

   Syntax:
        IF lexpr THEN
          statement_block
        [ ELSIF lexpr2 THEN
          statement_block ]
        [ ELSE
          statement_block ]
        END IF

   This creates a test, or series of tests. The statement_block
   under the first lexpr that evaluates to 1 will be executed. Any
   number of ELSIF clauses are allowed. If no lexpr evaluates to
   true and the ELSE clause exists, the statement_block for the
   ELSE clause will be executed.

   A special case of the IF statement is when any lexpr is a
   constant 0. In this case, the statement block is not parsed.
   This can be used for block comments.
        IF 0

        this is a dummy block that won't even be parsed!

        END IF

   Example:
        IF x = 5 THEN
          y = 7
        ELSIF x = 6 THEN
          y = 12
        ELSE
          y = 0
        END IF
     __________________________________________________________

4.6. REPEAT

   Syntax:
        REPEAT
          statement_block
          [ EXIT LOOP ]
        UNTIL lexpr

   statement_block will be executed until lexpr evaluates to 1, or
   until [EXIT LOOP] is encountered.

   Example:
        REPEAT
          xx = READ_ADC
        UNTIL (xx < 5)
     __________________________________________________________

4.7. WHILE

   Syntax:
        WHILE lexpr LOOP
          statement_block
          [ EXIT LOOP ]
        END LOOP

   statement_block will be executed as long as lexpr evaluates to
   a 1, or until [EXIT LOOP] is encountered. This is similar to
   REPEAT above, the difference being the statement_block of
   REPEAT loop will always execute at least once, whereas that of
   a WHILE loop may never execute (because the test is done
   first).

   Example:
        WHILE no_button LOOP
          xx = xx + 1
          IF (xx = 10) THEN
            EXIT LOOP
          END IF
        END LOOP
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 5. Other Keywords

5.1. ASSERT

   Format:
        ASSERT expr

   This is only useful if the "-emu" compiler option has been
   used, otherwise it is ignored. If expr results in a zero value,
   the emulator will stop at this point.
     __________________________________________________________

5.2. INCLUDE

   Format:
        INCLUDE filename

   This instructs the compiler to stop parsing the current file,
   open and completely parse the include file, the return to this
   file on the next line. Note the included file must have an
   extension of '.jal' and the filename may not begin or end with
   a space.

   Note that it is not possible to include the same file multiple
   times. Once a file is included, it will not be included again.
   Also be aware the the filename is taken literally -- no
   transform is done on it. This should be taken into
   consideration if you are writing a library as some filesystems
   are case-sensitive, and others are not, so "MYLIBRARY" and
   "mylibrary" might be two different files.

   Example:
        INCLUDE 16f877
     __________________________________________________________

5.3. Message generating

   The following keywords generate a message, just as if it came
   directly from the compiler. Each is followed by a string which
   will be displayed as part of the message.
     __________________________________________________________

5.3.1. _DEBUG

   Format:
          _DEBUG '"' ... '"'

   Generates a debug message. This will only be seen if the
   "-debug" compiler option has been used.

   Example:
          _DEBUG "this file is being deprecated"
     __________________________________________________________

5.3.2. _ERROR

   Format:
          _ERROR '"' ... '"'

   Generates an error message.

   Example:
          _ERROR "this function should not be used"
     __________________________________________________________

5.3.3. _WARN

   Format:
          _WARN '"' ... '"'

   Generates a warning message.

   Example:
          IF !DEFINED(foo) THEN
            _WARN "foo is not defined"
          END IF
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 6. Sub-programs: Procedures and Functions

   Syntax:
      PROCEDURE identifier [ '(' [VOLATILE] type { IN | OUT | IN OUT } i
dentifier2 [',' ...] ')' IS
        statement_block
      END PROCEDURE

      FUNCTION identifier [ '(' [VOLATILE] type { IN | OUT | IN OUT } id
entifier2 [',' ...] ')' RETURN type IS
        statement_block
      END FUNCTION

   The only difference between a PROCEDURE and a FUNCTION, is the
   former does not return a value, while the later does. The
   procedure identifier exists in the block in which the procedure
   is defined. A new block is immediately opened, and all
   parameters exist in that block. A parameter marked IN will be
   assigned the value passed when called. A parameter marked OUT
   will assign the resulting value to parameter passed when
   called. While in a sub-program, a new keyword is introduced:
      RETURN [ expr ]

   When executed, the sub program immediately returns. If the sub
   program is a FUNCTION, expr is required. If it is a PROCEDURE,
   expr is forbidden.

   A sub-program is executed simply by using its name. If
   parameters are specified in the sub-program definition, all
   parameters are required, otherwise none are allowed. A FUNCTION
   can be used anywhere a value is required (in expressions, as
   parameters to other sub-programs, etc). There is no limit to
   the number of parameters.

   JALv2 is a pass by value language. Conceptually, an IN
   parameter is read once when the sub-program enters, and an OUT
   parameter is written once when the sub-program returns. This is
   not always desired. For example if a sub-program writes a
   string of characters to the serial port (passed as parameter),
   only the last character written will be sent. For this case we
   need VOLATILE parameters. These are either read each time used
   (IN) or written each time assigned (OUT). This is accomplished
   using pseudo variables (see below). If the value passed is not
   a pseudo-variable, a suitable one is created.

   There are two ways to pass an array into a sub-program:
      PROCEDURE string_write (BYTE IN str[5]) IS...
      PROCEDURE string_write (BYTE IN str[]) IS...

   The first follows the pass-by-value symantics noted above. An
   array variable of size 5, str, is allocated in the namespace of
   the procedure. Any callers must call with an array of exactly 5
   bytes, which is copied into the local variable and used.

   Alternately, the second version created a flexible array. This
   is pass-by-reference which means (1) the amount of data space
   used for str is only two or three bytes, and (2) any sized
   array can be passed in. This is generally far more useful, and
   far less wasteful. The operator COUNT can be used to determine
   the size of the array passed in.

   Procedures and functions can be nested.

   Example:
      FUNCTION square_root (WORD IN n) RETURN WORD IS

        WORD result
        WORD ix

        ix = 1
        WHILE ix < n LOOP
          n = n - ix
          result = result + 1
          ix = ix + 2
        END WHILE
        RETURN result

      END FUNCTION

      xx = square_root(xx)

   Recursion is fully supported but due to the overhead it is
   discouraged.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 7. Pseudo-variables

   Syntax:
      PROCEDURE identifier "'" PUT '(' type IN identifier2 ')' IS
        statement_block
      END PROCEDURE

      FUNCTION identifier "'" GET RETURN type IS
        statement_block
      END FUNCTION

   A pseudo-variable is a sub-program, or pair of sub-programs
   that work as if they are variables. If a 'PUT procedure is
   defined, any assignment to identifier is replaced by a call to
   the identifier'PUT procedure. Similarly, if a 'GET function is
   defined, any time the associated value is used is an implicit
   call to the function.

   If both a 'GET and 'PUT sub-program are defined, the parameter
   type of the 'PUT must match the return type of the 'GET.

   Example:
      FUNCTION pin'GET() RETURN BIT IS
        return pin_shadow
      END FUNCTION

      PROCEDURE pin'PUT(BIT in xx) IS
        pin_shadow = xx
        port = port_shadow
      END PROCEDURE

      pin = 5
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 8. Interrupts

   Syntax:
      PROCEDURE identifier IS
        PRAGMA INTERRUPT [FAST]
        statement_block
      END PROCEDURE

   PRAGMA INTERRUPT tells JAL that this procedure can only be
   called by the microcontroller's interrupt processing. Any
   number of procedures can be defined as an interrupt handler.
   When an interrupt occurs, first the microprocessor state is
   saved, then control passes to the first procedure marked as an
   interrupt handler. Control continues to pass to each interrupt
   handler until the last, then the microprocessor state is
   restored and the interrupt ended. The programmer is responsible
   for clearing whatever bits caused the interrupt to happen. A
   procedure marked as an interrupt handler cannot be called
   directly from elsewhere in the program. Beyond that, an
   interrupt handler can do anything any other procedure can do.
   The order the interrupt handlers are called is undefined, the
   only guarantee is each handler will be called at each
   interrupt, and will only be called once.

   If an interrupt handler executes a sub-program that is also
   executed by the main body of the program, that sub-program will
   be marked recursive and incur the recursion overhead each time
   it is called.

   If FAST is declared, the interrupt handler will only save the
   minimum amount of state necessary. This must be used with great
   care -- although the microprocessor state is saved, state used
   internally by the compiler is not. As such, only a completely
   assembly sub-program should be used. Any JAL statements might
   invalidate the internal state of the compiler. If any interrupt
   handler is marked FAST then only one interrupt handler is
   allowed.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 9. Tasks

   Syntax:
      TASK identifier [ '(' parameter list ')' ] IS
        statement_block
      END TASK

   JALv2 introduces the concept of TASKs which are a form of
   co-operative multi-tasking. Unlike preemptive multi-tasking,
   where control passes from one task to another automatically,
   control will only pass when a task specifically allows it. Due
   to the architecture of a PIC, true multi-tasking is very
   difficult. Tasks can only be started by the main program, or
   within another task. Tasks are started with:
      START identifier [ '(' parameter list ')' ]

   When a task is ready to allow another to run, it executes:
      SUSPEND

   To end the task, simply RETURN or allow the control to pass to
   the end of the task. If tasks are used, the compiler must be
   passed the argument, "-task n," where n is the number of
   concurrent running tasks. Remember that the main program itself
   is a task, so if you plan to run the main program plus two
   tasks, you'll need to pass in, "-task 3".

   Finally, only one copy of the body of a task should be run at a
   time. The following would be an error because it attempts to
   run two copies of task1 at the same time:
      START task1
      START task2

      FOREVER LOOP
        SUSPEND
      END LOOP
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 10. Assembly

   When all else fails, one can resort to inline assembly. This
   can be in the form of a single statement:
      ASM ...

   or an entire block:
      ASSEMBLER
        statements
      END ASSEMBLER

   Using assembly should be a last resort -- it is needed only
   when either a feature is not possible using JALv2 (for example,
   the TRIS and OPTION codes), or when speed is of the essence.
   JALv2 includes the entire assembly language set in the
   PIC16F87x data sheet, several instructions from earlier micro
   controllers, and several common macros. There is some support
   for the 16 bit keywords.

   To guarantee the correct data bank is selected when accessing a
   file register, use one of the following:
      BANK opcode ...

   or
      BANK f

   The former takes the file register from the command, the later
   takes it directly.

   Similarly, to guarantee the correct page bits are set (for GOTO
   or CALL), use one of the following:
      PAGE opcode ...

   or
      PAGE lbl

   Again, the former takes the label from the command, the later
   takes it directly.

   Normally, the codes to set or clear the bank or page bits are
   only generated when necessary. If the bits are already in the
   correct states, no further commands are generated. If you need
   to guarantee the codes are always generated, use the following
   pragmas:
      PRAGMA KEEP PAGE
      PRAGMA KEEP BANK

   The former will keep any page bits, the later and bank bits.
   These affect the entire sub-program in which they are declared.

   To declare a local label for use in CALLs and/or GOTOs:
      LOCAL identifier[',' identifier2...]

   Once declared, a label is inserted into the assembly block by
   making it the first part of a statement, followed by a ':':
      identifier: opcode...

   The available opcodes are listed below. For a full description
   see the appropriate data sheet.

   Note that when using inline assembly you should not modify the
   bank or page registers, FSR, or BSR. If these are modified, it
   is the programmers responsibility to return them to their
   original states.
     __________________________________________________________

10.3. Data Directives

   The following allow data to be directly inserted into the code
   area. Retrieving these data is chip-specific. Also, as the data
   go directly into the program memory, the amount of space
   actually used is chip specific.

   Below, the term list is a comma separated list of constants or
   strings.

   db list
          Inserts a list of bytes, one per program word.

   dw list
          Inserts a list of words. On 12 & 14 bit cores each word
          can be 14 bits (0..8191), whereas on 16 bit cores each
          word can be 16 bits (0..65535).

   ds list
          Pack two 7-bit values into a program word. Not necessary
          on the 16 bit cores.

Chapter 11. Built-in Functions

   JALv2 attempts to be a minimal language with most complex
   operations done with sub-programs, however some functions
   simply cannot be efficiently supported externally.
     __________________________________________________________

11.1. Multiplication, Division, Modulus Division

   Multiplication, Division, and Modulus Division are internal
   mainly because there is no way to predetermine the size of the
   operands. Note that unlike the other operators which are done
   inline, these are function calls and require one stack entry
   when used!

   A second reason for having these built in is the optimizer --
   when a multiplication or division by 1 is done, the operation
   is ignored. When a multiplcation or division by a power of two
   is done, the resulting code is performed using shifts instead.

   For both of these operations, the code generated will be that
   required for the largest operands unless -fastmath is passed to
   the compiler.. For example, if the operation occurs only
   between two BYTEs, the 8-bit routine will be generated. If it
   occurs between BYTEs and WORDs, the 16-bit routine will be
   generated.

   If -fastmath is used, a different function will be generated
   for each argument type.

   The compiler keeps track of the last operation, so if you find
   yourself needing both the division result and the remainder of,
   a certain operation, make sure to put the assignments close
   together, thus saving a function call:
        n = x / 10
        r = x % 10

   will only result in one call to the division -- the assignment
   to r will be a simple assignment.
     __________________________________________________________

11.2. Floating Point Operations

   Most floating point operations are done via function calls
   because of the size of the code generated, so at least one
   stack entry will be used per operation. For multipllcation and
   division, two stack entries are required because these rely on
   the integer routines.

   Operations that do not require a function call include:
   multiplication or division by a power of 2, assignment from a
   constant.

11.3. _usec_delay(cexpr);

   _usec_delay(cexpr) is useful when an exact delay is required.
   It generates code that is guaranteed to delay a given number of
   micro-seconds. This is done using loops with one, two, or three
   variables, and no-op instructions as necessary.

   For _usec_delay to work correctly, interrupts must be disabled,
   and `PRAGMA TARGET CLOCK' must be issued to set the system
   clock speed.

   Note that _usec_delay() will generate delays up to 4,294.967295
   seconds (or ~71.5 minutes), this isn't really the best use of
   space. On a 20MHz 16f877 this required 1043 instructions.

   This is typically used for delays of a few 10s or 100s of uSec.
