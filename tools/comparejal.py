Description:
   Compare new device files with previous committed device files
   - skip header (about 35 lines)
   - when difference(s) show the first different line of each
   - when different show files with Kdiff3 (optional)
   - log names of files between which differences are detected.
   - generate commandfile to copy changed or new files to old directory.
   Output files are stored in the directory of the [PIC2JAL] environment variable
