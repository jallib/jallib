     With a script in REXX language convertion MPLAB .edc files

 2.  May 2013 - May 2014
     Using a script in Rexx language converting MPLABX .pic (xml-)files.

 3.  April 2014 - today
     Using a script in Python language converting MPLABX .pic (xml-)files.


 The changes in of all 3 phases are listed below.

              and 'byte*3' for 24-bit fields (e.g. TBLPTR)
            - 'word' specification for 16-bits fields (e.g. TMR1)
 2008/04/01 - .INC file not read anymore when not specified,
              it is not (yet) used anyway

 2008/04/12 - Several fixes in the shadowing functions.
 2008/04/13 - Made most shadowing 'put-procedures 'inline', which
              required minor change of pin_Xy'put routines.

            - added check on duplicate names -> comment line
 2008/04/19 - Register names included in duplicate check:
              bits or bit-groups may not have name of a register.
              Inserted line shows register of first occurance of dup.
 2008/04/20 - Duplicate field names are prefixed with register_name

 2008/06/23 - Generated file names are in lowercase (for Linux users)
            - Improved file reading / parsing of comment lines.
 2008/07/06 - MPLAB 8.14 used as info source
 2008/07/10 - When 18LFxxxx.lkr not found then first alternative
              is 18Fxxxx.lkr and second alternative 18Lxxxx.lkr.
 2008/07/13 - Discovered problem with .lkr files for 16F870/1/2.
              Partly shared memory ... temporary changed to unshared
              (in MPLAB files!!!) (thanks Joep Suijs)
              Applies to 16870/1/2/3[A]/4[A]
            - Skip .lkr lines which start with '//'
            - Fuses_def names which start with digit get leading '_'.
            - Bug fix for non-direction TRISx bits (esp. TRISE).
 2008/07/15 - Bug fix for assignment of non existing (shared or
              nonshared) RAM to variables _pic_accum and _pic_isr_w.
            - Builtin warning if PIC has only shared RAM, which is
              probably incorrect in the mind of JalV2, except for
              some specific chips (12F629/675,16F630/676).
 2008/07/16 - Removed code to process .inc files.
            - Some cosmetic changes in the .jal files.
            - Split procedures for reading .dev and .lkr files,
              needed to be able to process 'generic' .lkr files.
            - Added support for generic .lkr files (with #ifdef logic, etc).
 2008/07/17 - 0.0.24
            - Removed enumeration of multi-bit fields (caused many
              duplicate names and probably hardly used).
              Note: When enumerated in the .dev files, this is maintained!
            - Fixed bug with multi-bit offset (due to this code removal!).
            - Extended bit name search to 8 lines per sfr (was 4).
            - Removed 'pin_xy' naming for 'Rxy' names bits and excluded
              also these non I/O-bits from shadowing (bug fix 18Fs).
            - Bug fix: Bit field names other than Rxy for (multiplexed)
              PORT pins are now part of the include file.
            - Bit naming lines in .dev now also limited by 'nmmr' records.

            - 16F818/819 have 'abnormal' shared memory configuration.
            - Shared and unshared memory for 'exceptional' chips now
              hard coded in stead of scanning their .lkr files.
            - 12- and 14-bits core now use same code for these.
            - Changed pic_accum and _isw_w to high shared memory address for
              16-bits core; is more consistent with the baseline and
              midrange PICs.
 2008/07/21 - Include files will be stored in version-directory.
 2008/07/22 - Added sample program with comments to user guide.
            - Filespecs used and shown with forward slashed (Unix style).
 2008/07/23 - 0.0.27
            - Added procedures to set direction of upper and lower nibble
              of Ports (Port_x_high_direction, Port_x_high_direction).
            - When 'all' the .jal files go to a version directory,
              otherwise the destination is the current directory.

            - Added License information line to all created files.
            - 'include ChipDef' changed to 'include chipdef' in include files.
 2008/08/02 - All register subfields preceeded with registername.
            - No more shadowing of 18Fs, but forced use of LATx in stead of
              PORTx when PORTx is addressed for output.
 2008/08/03 - 0.0.32
            - 18Fxxxx port 'shadowing' moved to LATx register declaration,
              and pin_xy declarations use LATx register (was PORTx).
            - Fixed error in header: missing CompilerVersion number.
            - Significantly enhanced logic for 'enable_digital_io' procedure.
 2008/08/04 - 0.0.33

            - MPLAB bug fix for 12F510, 12F606, 16F506 and 15F526:
              'width' specs added for GPIO and PORTB in .dev files.
 2008/08/05 - 0.0.34
            - Bug fix Blink script: pin_xy_direction now generated.
            - MPLAB bug fix for 12F609: 'width' spec added for TRISIO in
              .dev file
 2008/08/06 - 0.0.35
            - Shadowing functions for 18Fs (use LATx for PORTx) temporary(?)
              without pragma inline (compiler problem).
 2008/08/07 - Synchronise files with changes in the style guide
              (parsable headers).
 2008/08/08 - 0.0.36
            - Converted all variables to uppercase ('port' and 'pin').
            - Bug fix for missing var declaration of low and high half of 18F
              Ports, and corrected namings: PORTx_LOW -> PORT_x_LOW, etc
 2008/08/08 - 0.0.37
            - Changed header: Compiler: >=2.4g (removed 'JalV').

            - Refinements for Brownout for fuse_def.
            - PicName is now lower case: PicName compare strings changed.
 2008/08/12 - 0.0.39
            - All names containing PORT_x renamed to PORTx, such as for:
              . PORT_x_DIRECTION,
              . PORT_x_LOW and _HIGH,
              . PORT_x_LOW_DIRECTION and _HIGH_DIRECTION
              Similarly for 'internal' names: _PORT_x_shadow, _flush, etc
            - Re-instated 'pragma inline' for enable_digital_io() and
              related procedures: no problems when no parameters passed.
            - Some bug fixes for pragma fuse_def OSC and WDT:
              . WDTCS (16F72x), DSWDTOSC (e.g. 18F24J11)
              . OSC: handle T1OSCMX (e.g. 18F1230) and FOSC2 (e.g. 18F24J10)
 2008/08/13 - 0.0.40
            - Bug fix: ANSEL0 was not reset in analog_off().
            - Enhancement: all ANSELx registers reset in analog_off().
            - Change in disable_adc():
              . reset ADCON0 bit 0 (was whole register)
              . set ADCON1 to 0xFF (was only bits 2..0)
            - Added support for ANCONx registers in disable_analog().
            - Minor internal script re-organization (order of procedures).
 2008/08/17 - 0.0.41
            - Converted names of variables and procedures back to lower case
              (with the exception of the port letter which remains uppercase
              (as in portA). Converted chipdef.jal constants to uppercase.
            - Removed the statements in the script to limit PIC selection
              for testing. Script needs now 1 parameter (mandatory):
               - 'prod' - destination is jallib\unvalidated\include\device
               - 'test' - destination is jallib\test
 2008/08/20 - 0.0.42
            - Chips with only shared memory must have their RAM declared
              as non-shared (compiler limitation).
            - Bug fix of incorrect limit for scanning registers/subfields.
 2008/08/21 - Not all NMMR registers are ignored anymore, some have to be
              taken into account. These are declared as pseudo variables.
              It mainly concerns OPTION_REG and TRISIO of the 12-bits core
              and ANCONx and some others of the 16-bits core (the 14-bits
              core seems not to have NMMRs). Current script has a preliminary
              implementation of the pseudo variables.
 2008/08/22 - ADCON0 set to all zero to disable ADC.
            - Bug fix parsing on 'ADDR' -> ' ADDR' (can be part of sfr name).
 2008/08/23 - 0.0.43
            - Changed compiler version reference to '=2.4' (was '>=2.4g')
            - JSG: added '()' with procedure declarations and calls.
            - Direction pseudo variables added for all existing pins.
            - Pseudo variables for OPTION_REG and OPTION2 subfields added.
            - Replaced most assembler in pseudo variables by JAL code.
            - Fixed bug for PORTA_direction (was fixed '6' now variable).
            - disable_ADC(): ADCON0 reset to all zeroes (undone change of
              0.0.40).
            - ADCON1 for midrange PIC-dependent (0b0000_0111 or 0b0000_1111).
            - Bugfix: wrong subfield declaration with 16-bits wide variables
              (such as TMR1)
 2008/08/24 - 0.0.44
            - Added shadow register for non-memory mapped registers, esp.
              for ANCONx of the 16-bits core.
            - Created a separate external' Rexx script to determine ADC-group.
              For 18F series a header file of MCC18 compiler is used, for
              baseline and midrange the data is manual input (datasheet info).
              Script is called by Dev2Jal and returns the ADC group of a PIC.
              Procedures for enable_digital_io() require ADC-group to select
              proper register settings.
              ADC-group is (temporary?) reported in disable_adc().
 2008/08/26 - 0.0.45
            - Bug fix disable_ADC() for group ADC_V4: ADCON1 = 0b0000_1111
 2008/08/28 - Made circumvention for compiler bug with allocation of shared
              memory with 18F series: shared memory declared as non shared.
            - Removed ANSEL declaration for 12F609, 12HV609, 16F610, 16HV610.
              (from .dev files in MPLAB).
 2008/08/31 - 0.0.46
            - RAM locations 0x7F-0xFF of 18Fs (temporary) not declared
              because of RAM allocation problem in compiler.
              See also change dd 2008/08/28.
            - Bug fix max unshared ram calculation.
            - Allowed subfield of a register to have same name as the register
              (example 'var byte PCLATH' and 'var bit*5 PCLATH_PCLATH').
 2008/09/01 - Added names of (some) register-subfields to the Name.- compound
              variable in the script for checks on duplicates and existence.
            - Added reset of T0CS for most baseline PICs in procedure
              disable_analog().
 2008/09/02 - Normalized 'pragma fuse_def IOSCFS' to F8MHZ and F4MHZ.
              Used in Blink-an-led programs to get 4 MHz in stead of 8MHz.
 2008/09/03 - 0.0.47
            - JSG: removed space between 'put and opening bracket.
            - Removed superflous declarations (var byte PORTx_low and _high).
            - Script 'TEST' option expects now PICname (was .dev filespec).
 2008/09/04 - Moved bit declaration in 'put procedures from procedure body to
              header (where possible) for improved readability and less lines.
 2008/09/05 - Datasheet number obtained from external script.
            - Minor parsing improvements.
 2008/09/06 - 0.0.48
            - Limit memory banks for 12- and 14-bits core to 4 (compiler
              limitation). Applies currently only to 16F59, but warning issued
              for all.
 2008/09/12 - Activated disabled 'pragma inline' statements for 18Fs, since
              these were not the cause of the code generation problems.
 2008/09/13 - Declared the lower half of the access bank of the 18Fs as
              shared again, and rehabilitated the upper half of bank 0 as
              data memory.
 2008/09/14 - Combined scripts ADCgetgroup.cmd and DS_Number.cmd to a single
              script 'devicespecific.cmd', to be extended later for other

            - Fixed sometimes wrong determination of program memory size
              (for PICs with support for extern memory).
 2009/01/29 - Fixed program memory size specification of 18Fs (now in words,
              for baseline and midrange it was already in words).
 2009/01/30 - 0.0.57
 2009/02/13 - Renamed OSCCON_IOSCF to OSCCON_IRCF for:
              12F635, 16F631/36/39, 16F677, 16F684/5/7/8/9, 16F690.

            - Revised default fuse settings of newer PICs.
 2009/03/19 - Added comments to fusesdefault procedure in devicespecific.cmd

              self-write capabilities (applies only to 16F8xx series).
 2009/03/28 - Using MPlab 8.30 as source, major differences:
              * ANSEL of 12F609 16HV610 and their HV variants now declared
                (undo a change dd 2008/08/28)
              * Rename of several register subfields, for example of
                the UEPx registers of the 18F13K50 and 18F14K50.
              * Several corrections, mainly sizes of subfields and bitmasks.
              * No additional PICs!
            - Fixed error in fuse_def PWRTE of 16F72x/16LF72x and some of
              the 18F series (was sometimes called NPWRTE or NPWRTEN)
 2009/03/29 - 0.0.62
            - Corrected minor error in headers: filespec of .lkr file
            - Reported errors and omissions in MPLAB 8.30 to Microchip
              (ticket 1-140852).
 2009/03/30 - Some minor script improvements.
 2009/03/31 - Added display of elapsed time to script.
 2009/04/06 - ADC group setting checked against MCC18 version 3.30.

            - ADC group of baseline and midrange checked against datasheets.
            - Added unchecked/checked comment to ADC-group assignment in
              devicespecific.cmd (all 'checked').
 2009/04/07 - 0.0.63
            - testing with compiler version 2.4k (beta)
 2009/04/13 - Changed default config word specifications from hex to binary
              format (conform datasheet).
            - Appended config bytes of 18Fs with comment CONFIGxL/H and
              of midrange PICs with multiple configuration words with CONFIGx.
 2009/04/14 - Revised DeviceSpecific.cmd for better performance (25%):
              all PIC specific data read once in associative memory.
 2009/04/15 - Set PLLEN bit in default config bits of 16(L)F72x to enabled.
            - Added specification of constant ADC_GROUP to every device file.
              Value '-' for PICs without ADC module, 'ADC_Vxxx' for others.
 2009/04/16 - 0.0.64
            - Added error checking for missing specs in devicespecific.cmd.
            - Added a set of ADC-group constants to chipdef_jallib.jal.
            - ADC_GROUP in device files specify now a symbolic name of
              one of these constants (was string).
              Specification of ADC_GROUP = 0 means: no ADC module present.
 2009/04/17 - 0.0.65
 2009/04/18 - Minor changes in output formatting (for html doc generation).
 2009/05/12 - Added enumeration of bitfield VCFG of ADCON0 and ADCON1.
 2009/05/13 - Removed code for bitfields > 8 bits for 12- and 14-bits core,
              these types of fields seem not to exist in .dev files.
 2009/05/14 - Added bit*2 declaration ADCONx_[P]VCFG for devices which have
              only the enumerated names in their .dev files.
 2009/05/22 - Fix for declaration of SFRs of 18Fs: only SFRs above
              (0xF00 + AccessBankSplitOffset) to be declared 'shared'.
 2009/05/25 - 0.0.66
 2009/06/01 - 12F519 has gpr 'PORTB' in .dev file in stead of GPIO and
              and nmmr 'TRISB' (in datasheet TRISGPIO instruction) in stead
              of TRISIO register.
              Corrected by editing .dev file: PORTB -> GPIO and TRISB -> TRISIO
              and similarly for their subfields.
 2009/06/05 - Text enhancements in devicefiles.html.
 2009/06/05 - Added 12F519 for setting T0CS in enable_digital_io().
 2009/06/07 - Declare 'flashdata' in .dev files as 'eeprom'.
              Applies with MPLAB 8.30 to 12F519, (12F520), 16f526.
 2009/06/15 - 0.0.67
            - Added pseudo variable 'ADCONx_CHS' for PICs with splitted CHS
              subfield in ADCONx register (applies to 16[L]F737/747/767/777).
              NOTE: Assumes CHS3 has lower offset than CHS!
 2009/06/17 - 0.0.68
            - Added pin_A3,1,0 and _direction for 18F13K50,14K50 and
              their LF variants (by correcting .dev files of MPLAB V 8.30).
 2009/06/28 - 0.0.69
            - Redone some changes of 0.0.65 - 0.0.68 which were lost with
              0.0.68 due to synchronisation error between two development
              systems of the author of the device files.
            - Using MPLAB 8.33 as source, new device files for:
              12F520, 18F66J93, 18F67J93, 18F86J93, 18F87J93, 18F87K22,
              18F87K90.
            - ANSEL of 12F609, 12HV609, 16F610, and 16HV610 rehabilitated.
              These chips have no ADC, but do have an analog comparator!
            - Start address of EEPROM (or flash) memory taken from .dev file
              when the region specifies a startvalue > 0 (some baseline PICs).
            - Fuse_def ENICPORT not specified anymore: only very few (18F) PICS
              have a dedicate ICD/ISCP port and .dev files do not specify it
              completely most of the times (e.g. only 'disable', not 'enable').
            - The following fuse_defs are not specified anymore because the
              config bits are not supported for the mentioned PICs:
              For 18F2410,2510,2515,2610,4410,4510,4515,4610: CPD, WRTD
              For 18F4585: EBTR_3, CP_3, WRT_3
              For 18F6520,18F8520: CP_4/5/6/7,WRT_4/5/6/7,EBTR_4/5/6/7
              Note: This action by the dev2jal script is required because the
                    .dev files still contain the specifications of these config
                    bits (although incomplete).
 2009/06/29 - 0.0.70
            - Bug fix: port shadowing of midrange re-establised.
              (error was introduced with script 0.0.68).
 2009/07/01 - 0.0.71
            - Added pin alias declarations from pinmap.py.
              Note: No provisions yet for multiplexed (config bit controlled)
                    function pins (most frequently: pin_CCP1 and pin_CCP2
                    pins). First occurence in .dev declared, others suppressed.
            - Some re-alignments for readability.
 2009/07/02 - 0.0.72
            - Added: const byte ADC_NTOTAL_CHANNEL = <number> (of AN channels)
              (when PIC has no ADC module this const is forced to 0)
            - Modified Pinmap file contains provisions to avoid duplicate
              names, solving issue with Note of version 0.0.71.
 2009/07/03 - Multi-bit subfields of ANSELx registers are enumerated.
            - Normalized ANSx subfields of ANSELx and ADCONx to JANSEL_ANSx
              naming
            - Declarations of 8- and 16-bit wide subfields with the same
              name as the register itself have been removed (considered
              not very useful with register prefix!). When names are not
              equal a bit*8 or bit*16 variable is declared.
            - Fixed some minor errors and omissions of version 0.0.71.
 2009/07/20 - 0.0.73
            - More compact format of pinmap.cmd for better performance.
            - PICTYPE, DATASHEET and PGMSPEC (without suffix) declared
              as string constants, and added DEVICE_ID as word constant.
              Removed corresponding comment lines.
            - Incorporated some corrections for MPLAB .dev files,
              previously done by editing of .dev files.
            - Using a table for fuse_def normalization
              (currently only for pragma fuse_def OSC).
 2009/07/21 - 0.0.74
            - RC and INTOSC default to CLKOUT.
            - Removed USB indication from 'pragma fuse_def OSC' keywords.
 2009/07/22 - 0.0.75
            - Generation of pin_ declarations for the 18Fs based on PORTx
              register specifications in .dev file (was LATx register).
              Reason: some input-only pins have no corresponding LATx_bit.
 2009/07/23 - 0.0.76
            - Using new pinmap file (result of Jallib issue #78)
 2009/07/28 - Pragma code for 16-bits core specified in bytes
              (see change dd 2009/01/29, and Jallib issue #57).
 2009/07/31 - Replaced '<type> var ... is  ...' by  'alias ... is ...'
              (requires JALV2 compiler version 2.4l).
            - Removed TRISAx aliases for TRISIOx pins of smaller PICs.
              These names are not used by libraries and should not be used
              by application programs.
              Note: Alias tables add pin_GPx aliases for these PICs.
 2009/08/02 - 'bit*4 PS' of T0CON splitted into 'bit PSA' and 'bit*3 PS'
            - Bit TxSYNC in TxCON register normalized to NTxSYNC for:
               - T1CON of baseline and midrange
               - T1CON, T3CON, T5CON and T7CON of 18F series.
 2009/08/03 - 0.0.77
            - Minor bug fix for declarations of JANSEL_ANS fields.
 2009/08/05 - Normalized TxCON_TOUTPS -> TxCON_TxOUTPS for 18Fs
              (not for baseline).
            - Fixed missing EECON bit fields of 16F526.
            - Cleaned up procedures list_sfr_subfields1x and
              list_sfr_subfields16.
 2009/08/06 - 0.0.78
            - Integrated parsing of pinmap_pinsuffix.json in dev2jal script
              (no more separate script and intermediate pinmap.cmd needed).
            - Fix for pin shadowing of 18Fs. Pseudo variables for pins set
              LATx (was PORTx). Bug was introduced with 0.0.75.
 2009/08/07 - 0.0.79
 2009/08/08 - Most constructs with multiple 'else if' replaced by a select
              construct for better readability and maintenance.
 2009/08/10 - Suppress pin_A4_direction declarations for T0CKI bit
              for 16F54/57/59 and 16HV540.
 2009/08/29 - 0.0.80
            - MPLAB 8.36
            - Rename pins of GPIO register from GPIOx to GPx (when applicable)
            - Do not generate device file when no datasheet of PIC available.
 2009/08/30 - 0.0.81
 2009/09/01 - Devicespecific.cmd converted to simple JSON format.
              Dev2jal script processes devicespecific.json (was
              devicespecific.cmd) for device specific information.
 2009/09/03 - Some code improvements (use of delstr and insert).
 2009/09/04 - Added aliases for ECCPxCON registers and their subfields to be
              able to access these as legacy CCP modules with corresponding
              names.
              For 18f448, 18f4480, 18f458, 18f4580, 18f4585, 18f4680, 18f4682
              and 18f4685 the ECCP module is accessible as second CCP module
              (ECCP2CON, etc).
 2009/09/05 - Extended devicefiles.html with a chapter about CCP module naming
              and aliases (work in progress).
            - Added bits*2 field 'DCxB' for CCPxCON registers with
              single bits fields CCPxX and CCPxY (16F91x and several 18Fs)
              or single bits DC1B1 and DCxB0 (16f88x).
            - Fixed naming error of ECCPR1L subfield of 18F448 and 18F458.
 2009/09/06 - 0.0.82
            - Added aliases for some SSP1... registers of the 18F series and
              their subfields to be able to address these with midrange names

              DS39775 and 18F87J11 family,DS39778) now all NMMRs ('alternate'
              registers) are declared with pseudo variables and:
              * the shadow registers are initialised to 0x00 (was 0xff),
              * the WDTCON_ADSHR bit is initialised to 0 explicitly to ensure
                default (legacy) SFR mapping.

              Note: For backward compatilibilty with previous device files
              the 18Fs have 'disabled' where 'control' would be more
              appropriate, since 18Fs have WDT software control.

 2010/11/11 - MPLAB 8.60
              Many config bits changed description in MPLAB .dev files.
              Needed rebuild of fusedefmap.cmd, with chances that new
              fuse_def OSC keyword don't match with previous versions
              (because of errors in previous or new fusedefmap.cmd!).
              Some fuse_defs have an new name (e.d. USBPLL -> USBDIV).

              starts with '1' or '0' (with warning).
            - Fixed bugs in some entries in fusedefmap.cmd like for
              18f6525 and introduced some new OSC keywords.

              No more need of .lkr files for data memory specs.
            - Fixed pragma shared of 16F818 (was 0x70-0x7f, now 0x40-0x7f).

 2014/02/15 - Use 'cname' in stead of 'desc' attribute in .edc file to
              determine fuse_def OSC keyword (via compound variable).
              Is more consistent and makes old MPLAB stuff superfluous,
              and no more need for file fusedefmap.cmd.
              Info messages are issued with mapping exceptions.
 2014/02/17 - Changed some fuse_def OSC keywords, fixed some errors.
 2014/02/18 - Removed fuse_defs of unimplemented config bits and

              to 'DISABLED'
 2014/02/21 - 0.0.26
            - Made a Python script to produce a list of sub keywords and
              descriptions of any DCRFieldDef keyword (name attribute).

              Takes some more instructions, but is conform MPLAB-X methods.
              To conserve some space this method is not used for the subfields
              the WDTCON_ADSHR bit is set/reset directly in stead

 2014/11/05 - MPLAB-X 2.25
            - For 8-bit wide bitfields use 'mask' to determine actual width.
              Since 2.20 bitfields which are the single bitfield in a
              register (or registers with less than 8 active bits!)
              are specified with width 8 and a bitmask for the actual width.
            - Fusedef nZCD and ZCDDIS normalized to ZCD.
 2014/11/27 - MPLAB-X 2.26
            - OPTION_REG_NWPUEN renamed to OPTION_REG_WPUEN
              because this is the name used in the datasheets.
 2014/12/08 - Added pin_A0/1 and pin_A0/A1_directions for 16[l]f1454/55/59.
 2015/01/01 - Year 2014 -> 2015
 2015/01/02 - More consistent fuse_def keyword choice for CCPxMUX,
              a pin_Xy keyword is used in stead of EN/DISABLE.
              For a number of high-end 18Fs a pin_Xy_Pq is used.
 2015/01/19 - Updated procedure ansel2j for 16[l]f176x.

            - Added some missing aliases in pinmap (e.g. AN0 for 16f1618/9).
            - Check for equal datasheet numbers in .pic file and
              devicespecific limited to last 4 digits (no suffixes expected!).
            - Corrections of ANSEL2J proc for ANSELx regs, esp. 14H series.
 2015/02/18 - Adapted script to allow it processed successfully by pydoc.
              Replaced block comments before procedures by documentation
              strings after the def statements (PEP257).
 2015/02/19 - Suppress declaration of 'RESERVED' bitfields.
 2015/02/20 - Fixed duplicate P1 and X1 keywords with pragma fuse_def PLLDIV
              (of 18fxxj94/99): P1 used for USB no divide, X1 used for no PLL.
 2015/03/08 - The device files are now generated under Linux Mint, which
              required some changes in the script for the paths of material.
            - MPLAB-X version 2.35 or 3.00 beta: the latter is slightly better.
 2015/03/18 - Small changes to improve usability with Linux.
 2015/04/03 - Converted compilesamples script from Rexx to Python and
              incorporated the compilerelease script.
 2015/06/13 - MPLABX v3.00
            - Changed name of origin of xml files extracted from crownking.edc.jar
              (removed extra directory level crownking.jar.edc).
 2015/06/15 - MPLABX v3.05
            - Added highest level subdirectory in 'source' of device file.
 2015/07/24 - Script version 0.1.1
            - Added support vor 16[l]f183xx PICs
              + ANSEL2J procedure for different pin ADC alias naming convention.
              + configuration bits: new OSC, RTCOSC and BrownOut keywords.
 2015/09/06 - MPLABX v3.10
            - New device files:
 2015/10/14 - Removed ENABLED option from pragma target XINST,
              JalV2 does not support extended instruction set.
 2015/10/23 - Script version 0.1.2
            - Added 16[l]f18855/75 (to ANSEL2J procedure).
            - Modified pinmap_create.py to handle aliases with blanks in name
              and suppress duplicate aliases (Vref- and Vref+ for ADC / DAC),
              this applies especially to 16lf18875.
            - Fixed fusedef WDTCSS to support another option.
 2015/11/10 - MPLABX v3.15
            - Enhanced determination and formatting of brownout voltage value
              Now rounded to next tenth of a degree (was truncated).
              Requires changes of some samples (using MINIMUM or V20 for V21).
 2015/11/25 - Script version 0.1.3
            - Added PPS_4: core=14H, presence of PPSLOCK register.
                    PPS_5: core=14H, presence of PPSLOCK and PMD0 registers.
              PPS_GROUPs 1 and 2 now derived from core and picname:
              PPS_1: core=14,18fxxj11/50, PPS_2: core=14,18fxxj13/53.
              Group PPS_3 now: core=16 and presence of OSCCON2_IOLOCK.

 2016/01/08 - MPLABX v3.20
            - Copyright end date is now automatically current year.
 2016/03/01 - Script version 0.1.4
            - MPLABX v3.25
            - Unnamed register subfields now treated as reserved.
 2016/03/11 - Added alias TxCON_TxSYNC alias for TxCON_NTxSYNC, alias
              TxCON_NTxSYNC for TxCON_SYNC or both for other TxCON_xxSYNC' bit.
            - Fixed minor bug in mask determination of SFR subfields.
 2016/04/01 - Added TxCON_Tx... and TxCON_TMRx... aliases when missing.
 2016/04/13 - MPLABX v3.26
 2016/05/17 - MPLABX v3.30
 2016/05/18 - Script version 0.1.5
            - List of RxyPPS output PPS constants now sorted on value.
            - Removed the addition of a useless PPS_CK alias for PPS_TX
              when no pattern present in .pic file.
            - Converted script from Python2 to Python3 (approx. 20% faster!)
            - Added a check for Python version 3.3.0 and inform user
              when an older version is actually used.
 2016/05/25 - 'Fixed' rounding of exactly .5 to an even number by Python.
              E.g. brownout voltage 2.05V was rounded to 2.0V, now to 2.1V
              Consequently several other voltages are now 1 (0.1V) higher.
 2016/05/29 - Make distinction for Brownout Voltage between "F" or "LF" PICs
              when 2 values are given in description (e.g. with 16f18855).
 2016/05/30 - Script version 0.1.6
            - Fusedef mapping dictionaries static (not explictly initialised)
              and replaced (most) fusedef PLLDIV code by a dictionary.
 2016/06/02 - Circumvent error in MPLAB-X (SD02 -> SDO2) in pinmap_create.py.
 2016/06/09 - Fixed missing PPS output synonyms of a pattern.
 2016/??/?? - MPLABX v3.35
 2016/06/23 - Added alias PPS_TX for missing PPS_CK
            - Added PPS_CK and PPS_TX from PPS_CKTX
 2016/07/27 - Replaced text 'part of Jallib' by 'following Jallib-style'
              in headings of generated files.
 2016/09/20 - MPLABX v3.40
 2016/09/23 - Added support for ANx pin mapping fot 18[l]fxxk40
              (new naming convention, like 16f18xxx)
              MPLABX 3.45
 2016/10/02 - Accept more keywords for SCANE fusedef
            - Minor improvement for brownout voltage description scanning.
            - Support for 16[l]f153xx, compensating for JoinedSFRs without
              children (maybe a temporary fix).
            - MPLABX v3.50
 2016/12/26 - Suppress warning about duplicate fuse_def for WDC
 2017/01/17 - Script version 0.1.7
            - So far with all PICs all LATx register came after PORTx
              in the MPLABX .pic files and the derived declarations for
              pins and shadowing were after the LATx registers.
              With 18f27k40 and others LATx comes before PORTx, which
              requires a different place of the shadowing PORT and pins.
              All pseudo variables and aliases need be declared after
              the last of PORTx and LATx in the device file.
            - Reserved fuse_def bits checked with 'startswith("RESERVED")',
              was checked for "== RESERVED".
            - Correction: PPS_CK2 (0x0F) must be PPS_CK1 for 16[l]f15355/6
            - Added PPS output for 18F series with PPSGROUPs 4 and 5!
 2017/01/26 - MPLABX v3.51
 2017/01/26 - In anself2j(): multiple 'picname.startswith()' replaced by
              picname.startswith((<list-of-strings>))
            - Fixed error with 6-bits subfields (these were missing).
 2017/01/31 - Script version 0.1.8
            - Minor optimisations: reduced fp.write() calls
            - Refactored normalize_fusedef_value(): replaced lengthy
              if-elif-else construct by subfunction calls
              (mimic case/switch construct). This is easier to read
              and maintain, and fractionally faster.
            - MPLABX v3.55
 2017/02/05 - Fixed missing disable of higher numbered comparators
              (e.g. 16f1779 has 8!) in JAL procedure comparator_off().
            - Fixed bit setting of CMxCON0 in JAL comparator_off() procedure.
              CxSP bit must be 1 for many PICs. Power-on-reset mask
              of CM1CON0 (as in .pic file) used for all CMxCON0 registers.
 2017/03/10 - Script version 0.1.9
            - Added support for 18fxxk42 (like PWRTS fuse_def)
            - .pic files of MPLABX appear to have an "edc:_addr" attribute
              for SFRs (new to me, don't know since which version).
              This allows to abandon calculation of current sfraddr.
              It fixes also wrong addresses of some SFRs of some PICs
              among which 16lf1566/7, 18[l]fxxk40/42.
            - Fixed some wrong pin_ANxy declarations with bigger 14H PICs.
 2017/03/13 - Some joined SFRs in .pic files have nzwidth 2 but should be 3
              (mainly in 18fxxk42 PICs). This caused script errors.
              Width of joined SFR now checked against number of joined SFRs
              (can be Muxed- or regular SFRDefs).
            - Reported JoinedSFRdef width errors to Microchip.
              (found later that some reported 'errors' are not so!).
 2017/03/18 - Script version 0.2.0
            - Optimized collection of SFR mirror addresses: limited to
              cores 12 and 14 en to PICs with mirror addresses.
              No differences in output with Script version 0.1.9!
              Renamed collect_sfraddr() to collect_mirrors()
              and sfrranges to sfr_mirrors,
            - Changed output of TEST run to ramdisk (also in comparejal.py)
 2017/03/20 - Added boolean 'jallib_contribution' to allow distinction
              between generation of Jallib approved device files (True),
              or private device files (False).
 2017/04/12 - Added alias 'MODE' for 'CCP1M' or 'CCP1MODE' bitfield
              of ?CCPxCON registers
 2017/04/19 - MPLABX v3.60
 2017/04/22 - Adding alias for PPS_SCL for PPS_SCK and PPS_SDA for PPS_SDO
              when SPI is present but I2C not in .pic file (e.g. 16f1615)
 2017/04/27 - Some adaptions of the scripts to simplify running it on
              another system or platform (supported: 'posix' and 'nt')
            - Relative paths (also in in related scripts) changed
              to absolute paths.
            - Converted some Jallib scripts to Python3 and
              added check on Python version >= 3.3
 2017/04/28 - Script version 0.2.1
            - Temporary disabled PROD option
 2017/05/04 - Added CCPIE/F aliases for CCP1IE/F
 2017/05/30 - MPLABX v3.61
 2017/06/27 - MPLABX v3.65
            - New PIC types (naming convention): 18...Q..
 2017/07/09 - Created new script "all-in-one.py" to generate device files
              and blink samples from scratch (e.g. with a new version of
              MPLABX).
              Most scripts now require environment variables "PIC2JAL"
              and "MPLABXVERSION", which can be specified 'manually'
              before running a script, but the all-in-one script takes
              care of that too (after being adapted to the system setup).
 2017/07/21   Script version 0.2.2
 2017/07/30 - Suppress expansion of subfields of PPS registers.
            - Fixed devicespecific.json for missing or wrong maximum
              ADC resolutions of some newer PICs.
 2017/08/12 - MPLABX v4.00
 2017/08/13 - Minor changes of all-in-one script:
              - Added logging of the pic2jal and blink-a-led scripts.
              - Removed superfluous unlinks of log files.
              - Make sure script is NOT run in destination directory.
            - Fixed ADC pin declarations for new 16[l]f191* PICs.
 2017/09/01 - Fixed missing declaration of pin_A5 when it is MCLR
              e.g. 16f1847, 18f1220, 16f19155(?).
 2017/09/18 - MPLABX v4.01
 2017/09/28 - pps_check script renamed to pps_groups.py and its output
              to pps_groups.html.
            - all-in-one script extended with generation of a html-table
              of PPS_GROUPs to be inserted in devicefiles.html.
            - comparejal script added to devpkg.
            - devpkg.py script and its README adapted to these changes.
            - Modified jallib.css to get correct display of ordered and
              unordered lists (probably html version related).
 2017/10/01 - Added special code for pragma fusedef PWRTE to support
              various delay values like with 16f19155, 18f25k42, etc.
              Similar to PWRTS for this.
 2017/10/12 - Removed (download-)date of datasheets from wiki tables
              in script createdswikis.py.
 2017/10/13 - All-in-one script: added warning when previous results present.
 2017/10/16 - Fixed error in dsclean.py with numbers 3000xxxx and 4000xxxx.
 2017/10/22 - Replaced 'mkdir' by 'makedirs' to be sure that also parent
              directories are created if necessary.
 2017/10/23 - Edited headers of scripts according to Jallib standards.
 2017/10/27 - Copied the part of the script extract_pininfos which creates
              a file with pin aliases into the pinmap_create script.
              This script creates a file 'pinaliases.json' replacing
              the file pinmap_pininfos.json. The pic2jal script adapted!
              The extract_pininfos script is not required anymore for
              device files generation and removed from the all-in-one script.
            - Excluded more pins from the pinmap_aliaslist in pinmap_create
              script (like D+, D-, etc.), there are probaby more candidates!
 2017/10/28 - Removed from the all-in-one script copy of 'constants-jallib.jal'
              to the destination directory. Not needed since compiler
              will include it from the current working directory.
 2017/10/29 - Script Version 0.2.3
 2017/10/30 - Added 2 fusedef collect scripts to distribution package.
 2017/10/31 - Added a removal of JalV2 unsupported PICs to the
              mplabxtract script.
            - Removed 're.match' on pictype from most scripts, since the
              mplabxtract script collects only JalV2 supported PICs
              and all other scripts use that collection.
            - Fixed omission in mplabxtract.py: missed baseline 16HV*
 2017/11/01 - Modified pinmap_create script for easier readable
              layout of pinmap.py and pinaliases.json.
            - Fixed error with additional RE3 in 18f2331/2431.
            - Fixed some missing pin aliases in high-end PICs (e.g. 18f86j11)
 2017/11/02 - Changed first line of all Python scripts to
              #!/usr/bin/env python3    (was #!/usr/bin/python3)
 2017/11/03 - Fixed error in pinmap_create and pinlist script:
              Shifting of RAx and GPx to front of aliaslist failed.
 2017/11/04 - Moved  conversion in alias names of '+' and '-'
              into _POS and _NEG from the pic2jal script to the
              pinmap_create script (for pinaliases.json).
              Fixed also double inderscores in some alias names.
            - Revised parts of comparejal script (no functional differences).
 2017/11/05 - Refactured mplabxtract script: extract operation performed
              internally by a Python function rather than calling 7ZIP.
 2017/11/06 - Changed platform checks from os.name into platform.system().
              This makes a distinction between Linux and Mac OS.
            - Scripts shared on Dropbox.
 2017/11/08 - mplabxtract script extended with searching for crownking.jar.edc
              in MPLABX-IDE when not found in MPLABX-IPE.
 2017/11/11 - Restructured and simplified the pps_groups script.
 2018/02/18 - Changed mplabxtract.py due to new format from MPLABX V4.10 onwards
              Small improvements to pic2jal.py to incorporate new chips.
 2018/03/11 - MPLABX v4.15. 8 new devices added. Fixed USBBDT address errors.
