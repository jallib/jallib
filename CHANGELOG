jallib-1.0.0
------------

Released 2014-05-29

Changes since 0.9.0

device files:
 - Based on MPLAB-X version 2.05 for use with JalV2 version 2.4q2.
 - Several fuse_def pragma's had to be changed because of
   misinterpretations of the MPLAB descriptions, among which
   pragma fuse_def OSC, FOSC2 and WDT, .
   Changed fuse_def CLKOEN to CLKOUTEN (18fxxj94/99).
 - All 'shared' keywords removed from variable declarations:
   + 'pragma shared' defines all shared memory regions (both SFR and GPR).
   + 'pragma data' defines all data memory (GPR).
 - Many more or less trivial changes, like sequence of bit-fields
   of SFRs and more alias names of bit-fields.
   Pin aliases now directly obtained from MPLAB-X .pic files.
 - Removed 'inline' from most pseudo variables: less code memory.
 - Shadow bytes declared volatile to prevent pin glitches,
   and now pre-allocated in shared memory (as far as available).
 - Changed PIC ID in chipdef_jallib to PROCID in MPLAB-X .pic files.
   Added this hex word as const CHIP_ID to device files.
 - Fixed default config bit settings of baseline and midrange PICs:
   Unused bits read as '1' of baseline and midrange PICs and
   as '0' for 18F series, with some exceptions!
 - Fixed accidentally suppressed ADCON2_CHSNx bitfields (14H core).
 - Fixed error with (mixup of) RC1/RC2 of 18f??39
 - Fixed missing pin_A3 (pin_MCLR) declarations.
 - Fixed missing pin_E3 (pin_MCLR) declarations.
 - Fixed missing ANCONx/ADCONx registers in enable_digital_io().
 - Added comment with range of remaining shared memory, if any.
 - Added constant ADC_MAX_RESOLUTION specifying the maximum ADC
   resolution (0,8,10,12).
 - Added PICs 16f753/hv753,
   16[l]f1571/2, 12[l]f1612, 16[l]f1613,
   16[l]f1705/09/13/16, 16f[l]f1717/18/19,
   16f1829lin, several 18f6xxx and 18f8xxx.

 - some more samples using new ADC libraries (16f77, 16f88, 16f876a, 16f877)

compiler:
 - JalV2 version 2.4l (required for 'alias' keywords in device files)

project:
 - Added PIC18F14k50 USB IO board board blog and example JAL files
 - Added PIC18F14k50 USB IO board board bootloader

jallib-0.3.0:
------------

Released 2009-05-23

Changes since 0.2

device files:
 - added tested device file 16f84a
 - changed name OSCCON_IOSCF to OSCCON_IRCF for 16F690 and
   10 others, and name OSCCON_IRFC to OSCCON_IRCF for 16F88x group
 - fixed NMMRs of 12-bits core: multi-bit bit fields now declared
   as bit*<number>  (was byte)
 - extended and improved documentation file 'devicefiles.html'
 - bug fix PORTx'get and pin_xy'get of 18Fs (read PORTx, was LATx).

externals:
 - lcd_hd44780_4/8 refactored (API changes, see deprecation warnings)
 - write-timing now CPU speed independent
 - infra-red GP2D02 distance ranger library

peripherals:
 - serial_hw_int_cts: add deprecation warnings
 - pwm libraries: shadow registers initialized to 0
   (so libs are compatible with Enhanced-PWM). Fixed pwm_off() turning
   pwm on when called twice.
 - added USB libraries

jal extension:
 - jascii: added 'tolower' procedure

samples:
 - corrected existing samples for refactored lcd_hd44780 libraries
 - removed some obsolete samples and added new samples for refactored
   lcd_hd44780 libraries
 - added 16f84a_blink sample
 - added pic18f4550 / pic18f2450 samples
 - added new USB samples (HID mouse, HID Generic, USB Serial)
 - added new GP2D02 distance ranger sample

compiler:
 - replaced by version 2.4k, see file README.txt of compiler for details

project:
 - Added lcd_interface application (hardware design, software). Provides access
  to an hd44780 lcd trough lcd_hd44780_serial_sw.jal and a single IO pin.


jallib-0.2:
-----------

Released 2009-02-01

Changes since 0.1

device files:
 - corrected program memory specifications for 18Fs
 - normalized MSSP register names
 - generated with MPLAB 8.20
 - corrected several fuse_def definitions

peripherals:
 - pwm_hardware.jal: new uniform PWM API. Whatever the number
   of PWM channels for a given PIC, include appropriate underlying libs.
 - adc_hardware.jal: now handles 8-bits only resolution ADC
 - i2c: i2c hardware slave library, ISR and message interface
 - serial_hardware with interrupt now also has same API as serial_hardware
   without interrupt.

jal extension:
 - random.jal - high-quality random with classic API

samples:
 - several i2c hardware master/slave samples


jallib-0.1:
----------

Released 2009-01-02

Changes since 0.1beta:

general:
 - libraries are licensed under the ZLIB license
 - jallib-pack: jallib released with JalV2 compiler binaries for several
   platforms, and with its documentation
 - samples are now prefixed by PIC's name
 - script to reindent jal code
 - documentation: links to samples now point to local files

device files:
 - some new device files
 - all updated with the latest MPlab version (8.15) info
 - fixed shared/unshared memory of midrange PICs
 - enhanced default fuse settings of 18F series

peripherals:
 - pic_data_eeprom.jal: now handles larger EEPROMs with 18Fs (more than 256
   bytes), pragma inline optimizations
 - i2c_software.jal: to write i2c software master
 - i2c_hardware.jal: to write i2c hardware master
 - i2c_level1.jal: high-level i2c library, for both soft & hardware libs
